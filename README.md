# Mine Sweeper as a Plugin in Unreal

This is what the title suggest a plugin for unreal to have mine sweeper (the
game). It was made using version 4.27.2 version of the engine, but it should
work if you don't go too far back. As soon as you launch it you will have to
compile and then you can execute it by clicking on the button in the menu.

When clicked you should have the Mine Sweeper window to pop.
